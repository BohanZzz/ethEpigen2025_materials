# Assignment - Week 01

1. If you don't have one already, create a github.com account, and send me your github username via slack.

2. If you haven't done it yet, install Bioconductor

3. Install the packages we'll need (see the [install.R file](install.R))

4. Create a R markdown named `assignment.Rmd` in which you:
  * load the epiwraps library (using `library(epiwraps)` )
  * print the session info (using `sessionInfo()` )

5. Render your markdown, and push both the `.Rmd` and `.html` files to your github repo, in this directory
